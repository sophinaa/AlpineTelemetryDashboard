## Alpine Telemetry & Race Pace Dashboard

This project is a C# / ASP.NET Core tool inspired by real F1 engineering workflows.
It parses lap telemetry (CSV), visualises speed/throttle/brake data, and simulates lap-time impact from fuel load, tyre age, wing level and ERS strategy. The aim is to show how software can support performance engineering inside an F1 team.
